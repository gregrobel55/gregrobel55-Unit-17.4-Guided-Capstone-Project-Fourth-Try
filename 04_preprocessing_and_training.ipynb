    "In preceding notebooks, performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

You partition the training set into k folds, train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training.

Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

    "**Q: 1** Write a summary of the work in this notebook. Capture the fact that you gained a baseline idea of performance by simply taking the average price and how well that did. Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "**A: The aim of this exercise was to find a linear model that best captured the relationship between the Adult Weekend lift ticket price and the other 38 features in the data remaining after the Third Step of this Unit. The first step was to separate the Big Mountain data from the data for the other resorts, because our ultimate goal is to determine whether its price is consistent with the prices of all the 273 other resorts. We  decided to split aim for a training set size of 70% of the data, and a test set consisting of the other 30%. We used a function from scikit-learn for this and obtained a training set consisting of 191 datapoints and a testing set consisting of 82 datapoints. We dropped the 'Name', 'state' and'region' columns from both datasets (but we saved them first). Both datasets then consisted entirely of numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a rough approximation to a linear model, we computed mean value of the prices in the training data (and, a bit later, of the test data). This turned out to be approximately 62. We verified this using scikit-learn's DummyRegressor method. We then assessed the performance of this model using three metrics: the coefficient of determination Rsq, the mean absolute deviation MAE and the square root of the mean-squared deviation, RMSE. (These three metrics were used throughout this exercise.) For this model, these values were -0.077, 19.75 and 29.466, respectively. We computed them both by using our own code and using methods from scikit-learn, and the results were in agreement.\n",
    "\n",
    "We observed that there were some missing values in both the training data and the test data. For each missing value we first imputed to it the mean of that value's column in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then scaled both sets of data so that each column had a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. we then linear regression to obtain a linear model for the training data. We used this to predict the output for both the training set and the test set. The three metrics mentioned above were used to assess the performance of this model. The Rsquared values showed that our model explained over 80% of the variance for the training set and over 79% for the test set. The mean absolute errors were roughly 7.5 and 11.2 for the training and the test sets, respectively. This is much better than our initial \"baseline\" model that just used the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then repeated these steps, with the difference that we imputed the mean rather than the median for each missing datum. The Rsquared, mean absolute error, and mean squared error were not much different.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to facilitate further work of the sort we have just described, we used scikit-learn's Pipeline feature to automate the following process:\n",
    "    1. Impute missing values.\n",
    "    2. Center and scale the features.\n",

    "    4. Assess the performance of the model using the test data.\n",
    "The resulting pipeline was tested using the training data and the test data, imputing medians for missing values as before, and the results were identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "We became curious as to whether we may be overfitting the training data, since our models have used so many features. \n",
    "\n",
    "We build another Pipeline to investigate this.  It imputed the median for missing values, centered and scaled the training data, and before doing the regression, invoked the SelectKBest method. The value of K can be whatever one wants, if one specifies a value, but defaults to 10.\n",
    "Runnng this Pipeline with this default value of K led to worse values of our three metrics than we had seen before. So using the ten best features did us no good! We repeated this, but this time specifying K = 15. The resulting model had slightly larger mean absolute error on the training set than the default model, but a smaller mean absolute error on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a pipeline that would iterate through the possible values of k, selects the best k features, and plots the resulting Rsquared  values The plot is shown below. The optimal value of feaures turned out to be 33. That is just two less than the 35 available features. The features are shown in Section 4.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 4.10, we used the random forest approach to linear regression. We did an initial fit and evaluated its performance (on the training data) using five-fold cross validation. Then we found 20 random forest estimators using using 5-fold cross validation and using the Grid Search method for estimating hyperparameters, using the training set. These were amalgamated in some unknown way in Code Tasks 24,25 and 26, and the reult was deemed to be the best. We checked it for the importance of each feature, and plotted the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, in Section 11, we compared the performance of the linear regression model and the Random Forest model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model outperformed the linear regression model on the cross-validation mean absolute error metric. We therefore choose to proceed with it in our future work.\n",
